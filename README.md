# EmailValidation
This project consists of a simple email validation form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form provides a visually appealing interface where users can input their email addresses. It validates the entered email address and displays a corresponding icon (valid or invalid) based on whether the input matches a standard email format.
# Features
•	Email Input: A text box where users can enter their email.
•	Dynamic Validation: The form dynamically checks if the email address matches the standard format (example@domain.com).
•	Visual Feedback: Displays an icon next to the input field to indicate whether the entered email is valid or invalid.
o	A green checkmark appears for valid email addresses.
o	A red cross appears for invalid email addresses.
# Technologies Used
•	HTML: Used to structure the email input form.
•	CSS: Applied to style the form and input field for a sleek design.
•	JavaScript: Validates the email input against a regular expression pattern, adding and removing validation classes to provide real-time feedback.
